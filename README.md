# sign-up-form
Sign up form for The Odin Project node.js path

A basic sign-up form for a fake travel business, following more-or-less the format for the assignment, but with a couple tweaks.  Small and straight forward.  

Javascript used for 'more info' popup, and password comparison verification.
